# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Overview and Purpose
In order to create a model to accurately predict credit risk machine learning models will be applied to solve the data set from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.In the analysis imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries will be used to build and evaluate models using resampling.
The following model will be used and related objectives:
##### 1. RandomOverSampler and;
##### 2. SMOTE algorithms to oversample the data;
##### 3. ClusterCentroids algorithm (CC) to undersample the data;
##### 4. SMOTEENN algorithm, a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling;
##### 5. BalancedRandomForestClassifier and;
##### 6. EasyEnsembleClassifier. The two models will be compared to reduce bias, and , to predict credit risk.
